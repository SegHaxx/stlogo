This is a disassembled (and partly
decompiled) version of Atari ST Logo.

It has been patched to fix
compatibility issues with newer TOS
versions, and to support extended
resolutions. Some optimization of the
language core has been performed, and a
few obscure bugs have been fixed,
plenty still remain.

It even runs in multitasking TOSs, but
needs deeper fixes to the UI to work
well.
